## Intro

*So, you want to start your own Hacker Hours!*  

You should also read the [Write-Ups](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki#write-ups) to get some backstory about where Hacker Hours came from and some additional perspectives.

This guide will address "organizers" and "mentors" in order to clarify responsibilities, though one person can certainly serve both roles.  "Organizers" are people who schedule the event and are generally in charge of coordination.  "Mentors" are individuals with greater-than-zero programming experience who are willing to answer coding questions.  These titles aren't official or formal - just to help for purposes of this guide.

## Communication

It's important to have a canonical source of information regarding the time and location, which will also be the place you refer potential attendees.  (Hacker Hours NYC was listed across two Meetup groups for a while, and all updates needed to be managed in two places in sync.)  [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) serves this purpose well, though a [Public Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37083?hl=en) or a [Facebook Group Event](https://www.facebook.com/help/185716894811068/) could also be fine.  It's great to have a mailing list for discussion between events, but it's best to have a designated calendar in addition.

## Format

## Skill Levels

When it began, Hacker Hours NYC was almost entirely absolute beginners.  Over time, the group has gained more regulars and a wider variety of skill levels, and now many attendees simply come to have a space to work and hang out with other coders.

## Scaling

As your attendance grows, mentors may have a hard time keeping up with all the questions.  Here are some strategies the organizer can use to mitigate demand.

### Segregate

You may have multiple people attending who are working with the same technology, or even have similar questions.  You can try surveying the group (via RSVP, introductions at the beginning of the session, or a whiteboard) about what individuals are working on, and then have designated seating areas for different topics.

### Roping People In

Experienced programmers are surprisingly willing to help newcomers, so reach out to friends or other members of your community to become mentors.

While it's great to have mentors that are experienced coders, these people may not always be available.  Remember that people just past the beginner stage have a fresh memory of what they learned and how they learned it, so encourage them to help field questions.

### Resources

Depending on the homogeneity of the group, you are may get a lot of repeat questions.  Keep a list of resources that you can refer people to.  Feel free to add to [the General Resources section of this wiki](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki#resources), or create a Page for a list that's more specifically relevant to your group.

## Tips for Organizers

* You will inevitably approaching your group (in-person or through email) trying to recruit.  Decide on a policy for how to handle these (TODO https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/issues/7).

## Tips for Mentors

* You aren't there to validate or critique business ideas. You are of course welcome to do so, but only if asked.
* Most attendees are very grateful for your time, but there will always be exceptions who are overly demanding.  Don't be afraid to tell someone to wait their turn, or that there are others that you need to attend to, or that they should post the question on Stack Overflow (and you can respond there at a later time, or not), etc.

You are awesome.  If you need anything, please [get in touch](hackerhoursnyc@gmail.com).
