title: Open Source Workshop
---

4/26/15 12-5pm, [Projective Space LES](http://www.projective.co/)
{: .event-details}

This is a workshop for people new to open source – we will try to have activities for every skill level / skillset. We’re still working out details around what project(s) we’ll be contributing to, but it will be some combination of:

* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials/guides
* Collecting resources
* Adding features
* Adding tests
* Fixing bugs
* Helping other people do all of these things

In order to have everyone with a baseline level of setup/knowledge, we ask that you get set up with GitHub and learn how to submit a pull request in order to RSVP. Please follow the steps below to do so. If you're interested in helping out as a project maintainer or a mentor, [get in touch](mailto:hackerhoursnyc@gmail.com)!

## How to RSVP

1. Click on the blue `+` sign next to the header `hackerhours.org/_data/oss_workshop/participants/+`.
1. In the "Name your file..." box, type in your GitHub username (which is displayed in the top right of your screen) followed by `.yml`. For example: `janesmith1.yml`
1. Copy this text and then fill in your own info. For the emoji, pick your favorite icon [from this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) – have fun with it!

        emoji: 'cookie'
