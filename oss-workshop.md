Did you know you can make meaningful contributions to the code powering thousands of websites, and running in millions of browsers? You can improve your coding, technical writing and collaboration skills, expand your professional network, and help advance the art of software engineering all in one fun way: contribute to open source! It looks good on your resume, teaches you how to be thorough and work within teams, and gives you inside access to some of the coolest projects being built.

## Format

This is a workshop for people new to open source – we will try to have activities for every skill level / skillset. We’re still working out details around what project(s) we’ll be contributing to, but it will be some combination of:

* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials/guides
* Collecting resources
* Adding features
* Adding tests
* Fixing bugs
* Helping other people do all of these things

In order to have everyone with a baseline level of setup/knowledge, we ask that you get set up with GitHub and learn how to submit a pull request in order to RSVP. Please follow the steps below to do so.

Interested in having people contribute to your open source project? Would you like to mentor? Want to ask a question? Have a suggestion for how we could make this workshop better? [Drop us a line!](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/issues/new)
