## Policies

### General

* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki/About#contact)!
* If you get stuck on a problem and don't want to wait until the next meetup, you are strongly encouraged to post the question to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), then send the link to the mailing list (hackerhours-list@meetup.com) with a brief description.  That way, you can potentially get an answer sooner than contacting a mentor directly, and the discussion/solution benefits others.
    * Make sure to omit any passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
    * See also: [Rubber Duck Problem Solving](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html)
