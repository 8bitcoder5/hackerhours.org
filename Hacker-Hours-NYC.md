[Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/)

## Policies

1. Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
1. Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships, via a message to hackerhours-list@meetup.com with "[JOB]" in the subject line.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki/About#contact)!
1. If you get stuck on a problem and don't want to wait until the next meetup, you are strongly encouraged to post the question to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), then send the link to the mailing list (hackerhours-list@meetup.com).  That way, you can potentially get an answer sooner than contacting a mentor directly, and the discussion/solution benefits others.
    * Make sure to omit any passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
