## Policies

* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships, via a message to hackerhours-list@meetup.com with `[JOB]` in the subject line.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki/About#contact)!
