> I emailed you about a junior role we had available at Yodle, and after you sent the note out to Hacker Hours, we were inundated with resumes. Which was awesome. It was kindof a tricky position because of the skill sets involved, and I was so amazed that we got such great response. We ended up hiring two people who came from your group.
