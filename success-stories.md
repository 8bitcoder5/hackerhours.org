> How did you hear about HH?
>
> > I heard about Hacker Hours through Meetup.com, it was one of the more active groups
>
> How did HH help you and your projects/ideas get started?
>
> > The people at Hacker Hours helped me so much when I ran into a problem. I remember Aidan showed me about a really cool gem that I had never heard of that solved a big problem I was having.
>
> What are some words of advice for future hackers looking to attend or mentor?
>
> > To beginners I'd say don't be afraid, just go. It's a totally laid back environment where people just want to help each other out and are totally cool talking to beginners and experts alike. Even if you just want to go there and work on your own, it's a lot of fun.
>
> What was your 'aha' at HH that really helped/inspired you?
>
> > My AHA moment was how quickly you can solve a problem with the help of others when it would take you hours on your own.

> I emailed you about a junior role we had available at Yodle, and after you sent the note out to Hacker Hours, we were inundated with resumes. Which was awesome. It was kindof a tricky position because of the skill sets involved, and I was so amazed that we got such great response. We ended up hiring two people who came from your group.
