## General

* Anyone is welcome
* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](/about.html#toc_2)!

General policies from above still apply.

* Messages can be coding/resource questions, or announcements *relevant to junior developers*.
* Any recruiting must include `[JOB]` in the subject line.
